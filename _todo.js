/**
 * Todo1: 
 * instead of pushing start and end coordinates for each of the lines,
 * i should instead push each coordinate and when drawing them, take the current and the previous.
 * this way we can also get the edges from the first and last place in the array and push or unshift the new coordinate depending on which edge is grabbed
 * drawing lines whould be done in a function with a pointer between 1 and length
 * 
 * Todo2:
 * create a minimun allowed length
 * 
 * Todo3: 
 * add a preset for line thickness
 * 
 * todo4:
